          y = -1*x3 + 0.5*x2 + 14.5*x  14  
from the list below.  If you can, do this without making more than one wrong choice in the process.  


sa     When x is large and positive y is large and positive 
sb     When x is large and positive y is negative and large 
sc     When x is negative and large y is negative and large 
sd     When x is negative and large y is positive and large 
se     When x is zero y is large and negative 
sf     When x is zero y is 14 
sg     When x is zero y is -14 
sh    When x is zero the slope dy/dx is -14.5 
si     When x is zero the slope dy/dx is -14 
sj     When x is zero the slope dy/dx is +14.5 
sk    When x is 1 the value of y is 0 
sl     When x is 1 the value of y is -1  
sm   The equation for the slope is a quadratic 
sn    The equation for the slope is a cubic 
so    The equation for the slope is: 
        dy/dx = -3x2 + 2x + 14.5
